"longDescription":"Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis gives an impassioned performance in this riveting drama that mirrors one man's 15-year struggle and ultimate triumph over a terrible injustice. Oscar winner Emma Thompson co-stars in this gripping film the Los Angeles Times calls, \"A politically charged 'Fugitive.'\" In the Name of the Father tells the true saga of Gerry Conlon. A petty thief in strife-torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the \"Guildford Four.\" An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer (Thompson), Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history."},

"longDescription":"A gripping and emotional legal drama based on a true story that moved France for three decades. Starring Daniel Auteuil (Jean De Florette) and Sebastian Koch (Homeland, The Life of Others). In 1982, André Bamberski (Daniel Auteuil) learns about the death of his 14-year-old daughter, Kalinka, while she was on vacation with her mother and stepfather (Sebastian Koch) in Germany. Convinced that Kalinka’s death was not an accident, Bamberski begins to investigate. A botched autopsy report raises his suspicions and leads him to accuse Kalinka’s stepfather, Dr Dieter Krombach, as the murderer. Unable to indict Krombach in Germany, Bamberski attempts to take the trial to France, where he will dedicate his life to Kalinka’s justice and the imprisonment of Krombach. Based on the true Kalinka Bamberski case, In Her Name follows the three-decade battle faced by a father to bring his daughter’s murderer to justice. Faced with challenges from the French and German legal systems, Bamberski’s story is one of perseverance and obsessive determination."},

And Maida turns wedding vows into a steel trap: If Alec files for divorce, she'll drag Julie into court as a homewrecker – and use Julie's little daughter as a witness. In one of their rare screen pairings, movie greats Cary Grant and Carole Lombard portray Alec and Julie in a tender, emotion-laden tale that ranks among the era's great romantic melodramas. While vindictive Maida (Kay Francis in a bravura turn) treats love like war, Alec and Julie treat love like love, displaying the warmth and deep devotion of a couple meant for each other…but who may be kept forever apart."},

"longDescription":"What does a name signify, exactly? Growing up in Durham, North Carolina, white filmmaker Macky Alston never questioned why all of the other Alstons at his elementary school were black. Twenty-five years later, Alston decides to unravel this perplexity in the award-winning documentary Family Name. Alston's quest to solve his genealogical mystery takes him from New York to Alabama and then back to North Carolina. He seeks clues at family reunions, graveyards, church services, and, eventually, the original Alston plantations. The people he meets vary markedly in race, age, class and perspective, but they all have two things in common: the family name and a compelling story to tell. The biggest question of this investigation, perhaps, is whether it will provide the Alstons with catharsis or create an even greater sense of division. As the revelations mount, Family Name unfolds an unforgettable emotional journey that transforms our conceptions of the past. Recipient of the Sundance Film Festival Freedom of Expression Award and myriad other accolades, Family Name is not only a provocative meditation on race in America, but also a poignant portrait of what it is that constitutes 'family.'"},
